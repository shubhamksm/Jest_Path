// Introduction to Jest

/*
  Writing tests have high impact in application development. The application will be stable and easy to maintain if the test results have few bugs.

  Jest is a JavaScript unit testing framework, maintained by Facebook that lets you define your unit tests.

// Features of Jest
/*
  Mocking
    Jest Allows to mock objects in test files.

    Can mock specific objects or turn on automatic mocking with ***automock***, which will mock every object.

  Snapshot Testing
    UI testing to become simplified as Jest can capture snapshots of React trees or other serializable values.
*/

// Jest is Fast !!!
/*
  Runs tests parallelly in processes to minimize test runtime.

  Runs previously failed tests first.

  Automatically finds tests related to changed files.

  Easy to set up JavaScript testing solution.

  Provides Test isolation i.e. no two tests will ever conflict with each other.

  Jest works well with other testing libraries (example Enzyme, Chai).
